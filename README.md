# 1. Introduction:
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and individuals alike. It can result in substantial financial losses and damage to the reputation of both the cardholders and the issuing banks. To address this issue, the application of machine learning techniques has gained significant attention. This project is an extension of Project 3 (Credit Card Fraud Visualization) and aims to develop a credit card fraud analysis system using machine learning tools and techniques to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions effectively.

# 2. Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
1.  To develop an interactive web application that showcases the analytical studies and visualization of credit card frauds for the sourced dataset.
2.	To study, compare and develop the most accurate supervised machine learning algorithm/model to detect fraudulent transactions.

# 3. Tools and Techniques used:
 * Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML.
 * Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Beautiful Soup, Splinter, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.
  * Tools: Jupyter Notebook, V S Code, GoogleCo Lab.


# 3. Methodology:
The project will follow the following methodology:
1. Data Collection: Data sourced from www.keggal.com
2. Data Preprocessing: ETL and web scrapping.
3. Data Visualization: flask app
4. Model Development: Utilize machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to build a fraud detection model.
